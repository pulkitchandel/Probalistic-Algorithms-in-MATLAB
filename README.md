# Interpolation
The process of finding the curve passing through the points *(x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>),(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>),(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>),...,(x<sub>n</sub>,y<sub>n</sub>)* is called as **Interpolation** and the curve obtained is called as **Interpolating curve.**

Let *x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>,..., x<sub>n</sub>* be given set of observations and *y=f(x)* be the given function, then  
the method to find *f(x<sub>m</sub>) ∀ x<sub>o</sub>≤x<sub>m</sub>≤x<sub>n</sub>* is called as an **Interpolation.** 

If *x<sub>m</sub>* is not in the range of *x<sub>o</sub>* and *x<sub>n</sub>* , then the method to find is called as **Extrapolation**.  
The Interpolation depends upon finite difference concept.If *x<sub>0</sub>,x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>* be given set of observations and let *y<sub>0</sub>=f(x<sub>0</sub>), y<sub>1</sub>=f(x<sub>1</sub>),..., y<sub>n</sub>=f(x<sub>n</sub>)* be their corresponding values for the curve *y=f(x)* , then *y<sub>1</sub>-y<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>1</sub>,..., y<sub>n</sub>-y<sub>n-1</sub>* is called as **finite difference.**

# Bisection Method
Bisection method is the simplest among all the numerical schemes to solve the transcendental equations. It follows [Intermediate value theorem.](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/intermediate-value-theorem.html)
