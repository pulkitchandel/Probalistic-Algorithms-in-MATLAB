# Newton-s_forward_interpolation
Interpolation is the technique of estimating the value of a function for any intermediate value of the independent variable
  - Forward interpolation formula is used to interpolate the values of y nearer to the beginning value of the given table.
  - Also this formula is applicable if in case where h(difference in intravel) is constant
